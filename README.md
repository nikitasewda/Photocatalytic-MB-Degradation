# Photocatalytic-MB-Degradation


---

## 🧩 Project Motivation

The goal is to develop a **visible-light-active, high-surface-area, low-cost photocatalyst** for dye degradation using:

- 3D-printed PEGDA structures  
- Ni-doped pyrolytic carbon (conductive + porous)  
- Cu₂O semiconductor coating  
- Ag nanoparticles (drop-casted) for plasmonic enhancement  

This hybrid catalyst improves **light harvesting**, **charge separation**, and **ROS generation**, accelerating MB degradation.

## 🔬 Characterization Techniques & Key Results

### **1. SEM / FESEM**
- Revealed **porous, interconnected carbon network** after pyrolysis  
- Surface roughness increased with higher Ni content  
- Cu₂O formed **uniform cubic and polyhedral grains** across the scaffold  
- Ag drop-cast produced **bright nanoparticles** distributed on Cu₂O surfaces  
- Ni-5% sample showed the best **morphology + Cu₂O adhesion**

### **2. EDS (Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy)**
- Confirmed presence of:  
  - **C** (PyC)  
  - **Ni** (doping)  
  - **Cu** and **O** (Cu₂O layer)  
  - **Ag** (plasmonic nanoparticles)  
- Elemental mapping showed **uniform Cu and O distribution**, with Ag localized as small clusters

### **3. XRD**
- Peaks corresponding to **Cu₂O (cubic phase)**  
- Broad carbon peak confirming **amorphous PyC**  
- Ni-doping did not distort Cu₂O but improved crystallinity  
- Ag presence indicated by characteristic peaks around **38°, 44° (Ag (111), (200))**

### **4. Raman Spectroscopy**
- Clear **D band (~1350 cm⁻¹)** and **G band (~1580 cm⁻¹)** of carbon  
- ID/IG ratio indicated:
  - Increased disorder from Ni doping  
  - Improved graphitization at moderate doping (≈5%)  
- Additional Cu–O vibration peaks confirm Cu₂O formation  
- Ag enhanced the Raman signal (plasmonic effect)
